# tkinter GUI demos
### Comparing various _tkinter_ GUI packages

- _staight_ __tkinter__ (tkdemo.py)
- __ttkthemes__ ThemedTK (tkdemottk.py)
- __ttkbootstrap__ (tkdemoBoots.py)
- __awthemes__ (tkawdark.py)
- __Sun Valley ttk__ (tkdemoSV.py)


Here I have prepared a python3 program with a handful of typical widgets.
The same program is used to showcase the straight tkinter GUI style, and
four other GUI packages written for python/tkinter.

The best GUI libraries for Python tkinter would be GTK3 and QT. Both of those
are difficult to learn, and GTK does not work well outside of Linux.

In my opinion _tkinter_ is for the programmer who needs to write a solid
GUI application, but not necessarily an enterprise level application.

The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the 
Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, 
including macOS, as well as on Windows systems. Python/tkinter programs work
almost flawlessly (without alteration) across different OS.

ttkbootstrap has more modern-familiar features than the other modules here.
I find the ttkbootstrap works best on Linux/macOS system. The ttkthemes
module is older, and has _some_ very attractive themes. For instance, the
"vista" ttktheme is extremely close to the default Windows 10/11 light theme.

Clone this repository and take a look at these demos. Maybe you'll decide
to use one or more. Perhaps you'll decide to try GTK or QT instead.

Note: my demo program is only for displaying widgets; not for anything
else.
